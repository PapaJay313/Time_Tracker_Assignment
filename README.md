Project Name: Time_Tracker_Program

INTRODUCTION 

This program seeks to solve a problem faced by a client who whose earning depends on the amount of time he spends working on his client's projects. To solve his problem, we will create a Time tracking program which will calculate the time he spend and the amount he earns during such periods.

PROBLEM

Nana, who is a customer, is in needs of a program that can calculate hours spent on the work he does for his customers as well as the amount of money he will make at a rate of five dollars ($5) per hour.

SOLUTION

The language in which the time tracking program was written in is Python. Below is he description how to use the program.
The Time Tracking Program is a program that allows any user in this case “Nana” by; 

•	Clicking on the start when he is about to begin working.

•	The program will display the start time and date and also start recording the time spent on the program as he is working.

•	When he is done working, he then enters the charge or amount per hour in the space provided, this will calculate the amount of money he has tackling a project at a rate of $5 per hour.

•	The program then stores the information concerning the various activities in a csv file for future references

HOW IT WORKS

When the program interface is opened, it will;

•	Instruct the user to click on the start button to begin working.
•	The current systems date and time will display as the starting time.
•	The program the automatically track the amount of time spend working.
•	When work is done the user has the choice to enter the amount per hour and click on stop.
•	The program then displays current system’s date and time as the ending time.
•	This will then the time spent and the amount earned in dollars and send the information to the csv file in excel. 

CONCLUSION

This Time Tracking Program executes with no errors. It therefore satisfies the customer’s needs.
